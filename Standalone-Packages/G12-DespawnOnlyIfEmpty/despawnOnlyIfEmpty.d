/*
 *	Super simple feature that will prevent dead bodies from despawning.
 *	 - we are replacing engine function oCNpc::HasMissionItem (this function is called when engine tries to despawn dead bodies) with our own version that returns TRUE whenever there is anything in the inventory of NPC
 *	 - I know, G2A has this already as an option that can be turned on in .ini ... but I like to have an option to do things from scripts :)
 *
 *	Warnings:
 *	 - since we are replacing engine function oCNpc::HasMissionItem - obviously it cannot be used anymore to check whether NPC has mission items ... use NPC_HasMissionItem instead!
 *	 - do not use with spawn time set to 0 - this will cause huge lag spikes if you have a lot of dead bodies in your world!
