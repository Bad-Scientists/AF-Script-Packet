## G12 Multi-teleport
 - feature adds multi-teleport to key `3` (which, let's be honest no one was using anyway :smile: )
 - it automatically registers all `TELEPORT*` spells in your inventory to separate spell book - you can use arrows to navigate through teleportation spells

Init function: `G12_MultiTeleport_Init ();`

Recommendation: use patch [G12_SetMagBookTurnTime](../Readme/G12_Set_Mag_Book_Turn_Time.md) to update speed with which mag book moves from one spell to another.
