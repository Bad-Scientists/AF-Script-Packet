## G12 Better Bars

## :construction: :construction_worker: :construction: README UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction: :construction_worker: :construction:

 - This feature 'replaces' original Gothic health and mana bars with LeGo bars where we can control textures, alpha values and when bars should be displayed.
This feature adds 4 visualization options:
   - Standard (same as in vanilla Gothic)
   - Dynamic:
      * Health bar is visible if player is hurt, in fight mode, in inventory or when health changes
      * Mana bar is visible in magic fight mode, in inventory or when mana changes
   - Always on
   - Only in the inventory

 - This also adds health & mana bar preview in combination with `G12-InvItemPreview`, additional texture indicates how much health or mana item in inventory recovers:
