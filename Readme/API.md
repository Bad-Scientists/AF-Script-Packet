## API files
Many features have customization options, some of them will not work without you customizing them.

For example [G12 No ammo print](G12_No_Ammo_Print.md) - simple feature that will 'print' info for player not having ammo for ranged weapons.
Text has to be translated to other languagues, you might have your own types of ammo (poisoned arrows, magical arrows, exploding arrows etc.)

**This is why we have introduced 'API' (application programming interface) files.**

These files are basically examples of customization. Copy them to separate folder, customize them and link them to `Gothic.src`.
With next update of AFSP where you will download latest version your customization will stay intact.

Have a look at **G12 No ammo print** [API file](../Standalone-Packages/G12-NoAmmoPrint/noAmmoPrint_API.d) to get better idea on how it should work.
